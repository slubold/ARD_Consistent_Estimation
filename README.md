# Consistent estimation of network statistics with aggregated relational data

This repository contains the R code to reproduce the figures that demonstrate the consistency claims in Theorem 1 of our paper ["Consistently estimating network statistics with Aggregated Relational Data"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1908.09881). It also contains the HTML file for the [site](slubold.github.io/ARD_Consistent_Estimation) that illustrates the estimation procedure used to prove Theorem 1 and contains simulations that verify this theorem.
